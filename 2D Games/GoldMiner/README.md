8. *Gold Miner*

    - Fixed a bug where the claw would pick up multiple objects, but did not correctly collect them when pulled in all the way.
    - Now continuously spawns gems and rocks randomly.
    - Every 5th object spawned will be a new time powerup that will increase your time.
    - Increased the winning condition goal.
